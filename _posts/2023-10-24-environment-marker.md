Today I learned about a handy [chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/environment-marker/ahjhdebcnlgmojdmjnhikhakkghcchkk/related) for helping track which ServiceNow (or any other product) environment you are in. This is particularly useful if you are managing customer instances and are not in a position to update server side themes since you can manage it in your browser.

Example:  
!![]({{ 'assets/images/EnvironmentMarker.PNG' | relative_url }})
